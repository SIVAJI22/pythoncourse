<h1>Python¬Æ ‚Äì the language of today and tomorrow</h1>
    <p>Python is the gift that keeps on giving. The more you understand Python,
         the more you can do in the 21st Century. As simple as that.</p>

    <h5>First of all, what is Python? According to its creator, Guido van Rossum, Python is a:</h5>

<p id="para ">
<div id="v" ></div>
    ‚Äúhigh-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code
     readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code.‚Äù</p> <br />

<h5>Why Python?</h5>

<p>For me, the first reason to learn Python was that it is, in fact, a beautiful programming language.
 It was really natural to code in it and express my thoughts.</p>



<p>
<div id="v1" ></div>Another reason was that we can use coding in Python in multiple ways: data science, 
web development, and machine learning all shine here. Quora, Pinterest and Spotify
 all use Python for their backend web development. So let‚Äôs learn a bit about it</p>

         <h3>What</h3>
         <p>Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. It‚Äôs everywhere, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not.

</p>
<h3>Who</h3>
<p>Python was created by <a href=""> Guido van Rossum</a>, and first released on February 20, 1991. While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming
     language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python‚Äôs Flying Circus.</p><br />
     <p>One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person‚Äôs work. Usually,
         new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of 
         professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the
          project. Python is an exception.

</p>
<p>Of course, Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself. The speed with which Python has spread around the world is a result of the continuous work of thousands (very often anonymous) programmers, testers, users (many of them aren‚Äôt IT specialists) and enthusiasts, but it must be said that the very first idea (the seed from which Python sprouted) came to one head ‚Äì Guido‚Äôs.

</p>
<p>Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation, a non-profit membership organization and a community devoted to developing,
     improving, expanding, and popularizing the Python language and its environment.</p>

     <h3>
Why</h3>
<p>Python is omnipresent, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. There are billions of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. What‚Äôs more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.

</p>
<p>There are also a couple of factors that make Python great for learning:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>It is easy to learn ‚Äì the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it‚Äôs possible to start the actual programming faster;</li>
<li>It is easy to use for writing new software ‚Äì it‚Äôs often possible to write code faster when using Python;
</li>
<li>It is easy to obtain, install and deploy ‚Äì Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.
</li>

</ul>

<p>Programming skills prepare you for careers in almost any industry, and are required if you want to continue to more advanced and higher-paying software development and engineering roles. Python is the programming language that opens more doors than any other. With a solid knowledge of Python, you can work in a multitude of jobs and a multitude of industries. And the more you understand Python, the more you can do in the 21st Century. Even if you don‚Äôt need it for work, you will find it useful to know.

</p>

<h2>Python goals</h2>
<p>In 1999, Guido van Rossum defined his goals for Python:</p>
<ul>
    <li>an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as those of the major competitors;</li>
    <li></li>

<li>open source, so anyone can contribute to its development;
</li>
<li>code that is as understandable as plain English;</li>
<li>suitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times.
</li>
</ul>
<p>20+ years later, it is clear that all these intentions have been fulfilled. Some sources say
     that Python is the first-most popular programming language in the world, while others claim it‚Äôs the 
     third.</p>

     <p>Either way, it occupies the first position in the top ten of the <a href="">TIOBE Programming Community</a> 
      and <a href="">PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language </a> Indexes. (February 2022)</p> <br />
      <p>Python isn‚Äôt a young language. It is mature and trustworthy. It‚Äôs not a one-hit wonder. It‚Äôs a bright star in the programming firmament, and time spent learning Python is a very good
         investment.</p>

</Row>
<h3>Python examples</h3>
<span>Python is a great choice for:</span>
<br /> <br />
<ul>

<li>Web and Internet development (e.g., Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)</li>
    <li>Scientific and numeric computing (e.g., SciPy ‚Äì a collection of packages for the purposes of mathematics, science,
         and engineering; Ipython ‚Äì an interactive shell that features editing and recording of work sessions)</li>
    <li>Education (it‚Äôs a brilliant language for teaching programming!)</li>
    <li>Desktop GUIs (e.g., wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt)</li>
    <li>Software Development (build control, management, and testing ‚Äì Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)</li>
    <li>Business applications (ERP and e-commerce systems ‚Äì Odoo, Tryton)</li>
    <li>Games (e.g., Battlefield 
        series, Sid Meier‚Äôs Civilization IV‚Ä¶), websites and services (e.g., Dropbox, UBER, Pinterest, BuzzFeed...)</li>
    <li>.......</li>

</ul>

             <h1>What Pythonistas Are Saying:</h1>  <br />
 <p>Real Python has been around since 2012. And ever since the first
     days, we‚Äôve been grateful to affect the ‚ÄúPython Journey‚Äù of so many readers like you.
      Here‚Äôs what some of them had to say about us:

</p>         <div class="alert alert-secondary">
                
                
                <blockquote>
<p>‚Äú<strong>Real Python is an awesome resource for the budding developer.</strong> Not 
only will you learn Python, you will learn how to use it as you build practical and functional web-based applications.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äî <em>Jared Nielsen</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äú<strong>You do a wonderful job of explaining and teaching
     Python in a way that people like me, a complete novice, could really grasp.</strong> 
     I think you have a gift for making Python seem more attainable to people outside the programming world. 
     This is something I never thought I would be doing or learning and with a little push from you I am
      learning it and I can see that it will be nothing but beneficial to me in the future.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚Äú<strong>The best way to learn Python without killing yourself is Real Python!!</strong>‚Äù </p>
<p>‚Äî <em>Stavros Anastasiadis</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been using Python for two years, and my skills have increased over time. I‚Äôve been able to do this by constantly trying to learn new concepts, of OOP programming for example, and different Python coding strategies like decorators or list comprehensions. </p>
<p>I will then go out and build my own stuff. Once I get tired of implementing the same coding concepts, and want to do something new and better, I‚Äôll go back to the drawing board and learn more coding. This cycle has helped me retain what I‚Äôve learned and keep growing. </p>
<p><strong>Reading what Real Python has to say, like their blog and books, will help you achieve this.</strong>‚Äù </p>
